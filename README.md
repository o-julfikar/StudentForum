# StudentForum: BRACU Student Portal
This application comes with a lot of features that almost any student need. Highlighting the very few:

## Forum
> Students can easily share their thoughts and ideas among their fellow mates with by posting a **Post** which includes smart #tag system and search through the post quickly with handly filtering options.

## Feedback
> A most wanted feature that all the students want is freedom to provide their valuable and honest feeback to their respected faculties. And they need a trusted and anonymous system to be honest with their reviews. 
And this application aims to provide that at it's best. The application maintains data integrity by filtering spams while keeping the student's privacy as the most priority.

## Swap
> This has mainly two parts, **Section Swap** and **Study Swap**.

#### Section Swap
> During advising period, students faces a lot of difficulties getting their desired course or section that matches their time schedule perfectly. 
Not only students, even the advisors find the advising week pretty tough to manage and process al the student's request. This application not only 
solve that hassle that students and teachers has to go every semester, the greedy algorithm used in this application finds out the section swap 
that guarantees maximum students' request. When found a match for a swap, the student only need to click on the Request button and the system will
automatically notify all the students in the list and if all of them still prefer the swapping, the system will automatically pass the request to main system.

#### Study Swap
> The fact cannot be denied that some students' get strength in some course and some doe not. And most of the time self studying requires more time and due to
lots of students to manage, teachers have a very limited time to assist them. With increasing population and students, the problem has grown even more that 
Student Tutor may even could not assist all the students individually. Hence, a system that can solve this problem is very important. And, the application
not only meant to solve existing problem but also follows the same greedy approach as Section Swap with much better flexibility so that maximum students can 
be benefitted from the system and each students can learn and skill up their knowledge in courses they may have weakness in cost of teach the courses they are
good at. Which actually benefits them even more, because teaching is a part of learning. Hence this creates a wonderful Win-Win situation for students who want
improve their knowledge and broaden their field expertise.
